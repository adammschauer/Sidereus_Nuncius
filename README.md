# Sidereus Nuncius LaTeX Project

Inspired by https://github.com/raphink/geneve_1564 (via ![Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1319/showcase-of-beautiful-typography-done-in-tex-friends)), I decided to copy the same approach of utilizing XeLaTeX and the EB Garamond font to reproduce a classic text, but in this case, applying the approach to the Siderus Nuncius by Galileo. The intent is to get as close as possible to the original while obviously cleaning up the placement of the text and overall formatting from the original.

Per Wikipedia:

"Sidereus Nuncius (usually Sidereal Messenger, also Starry Messenger or Sidereal Message) is a short astronomical treatise (or pamphlet) published in New Latin by Galileo Galilei on March 13, 1610. It was the first published scientific work based on observations made through a telescope, and it contains the results of Galileo's early observations of the imperfect and mountainous Moon, the hundreds of stars that were unable to be seen in either the Milky Way or certain constellations with the naked eye, and the Medicean Stars (later Galilean moons) that appeared to be circling Jupiter."
